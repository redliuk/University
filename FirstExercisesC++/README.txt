In this section we have a bunch of C++ exercies of pure matematic nature:

Execercises:
	My first code written, simple exercies where i took my time to explore the basic data structures and operation
Lab1:
	Exercies on machine error evaluetion and numeric stability.
Lab2:
	Exercies on linear system resolution.

WHAT I LEARNED
	C++ syntax, basic data structures and libraries.
