Qiskit is a bunch of python libraries from IBM for quantum computing programming, quite exciting stuff.

ShorAlgorithmNotebook:
	This is an implementation of Shor alghoritm with the Quantum Fourier Tranform function to have a exponential speed up
	and break the RSA.


WHAT I LEARNED
	How to convert the Quantum computing knowledge in actual quantum circuits and
	how to test them in real quantum computers.
